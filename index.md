# A blog, perhaps
I'm not much of a writer, but I am a thinker. Deeper thinking, ironically, is supported by writing. What that means is that I'll need to learn to write better.

## Some things to consider adding to a blog
- I'd like to keep some thoughts on my productivity method(s) as I refine them.
- It might be nice to keep some coding methods I've learned, stumbled across, or want to try in a referenced list, in case they are helpful for others.
- That's it for starters; I have more things to add, but it's time I saved this to see how it shakes out on the web.

#### Wish me luck...
